Project 3
This website is built for those trying to utilize a TODO list using React.js. This is a great way to add and delete things you would like to do. 
It also has an interactive form in the Navbar that can be used to contact me directly. 
Please view the Project3snip to view the project! Thanks for taking a look. Happy Hacking!
